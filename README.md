• Evaluated net profit, total revenue, and inventory distribution by category and sub-category
• Built dynamic dashboards covering sales performance, inventory efficiency, and customer behavior
• Enabled drill-through analysis across Year → Quarter → Month → Day for granular trend exploration
• Integrated multi-dimensional slicers for filtering by product hierarchy, geography, customer segments, and personnel
• Segmented results by year, region, and customer segment for trend forecasting

Key Insights
